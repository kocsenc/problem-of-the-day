Matrix Rotation
The bank manager at my local bank recently gave me the algorithm to access the bank's vault. I thought I'd pass on the algorithm to you all for "safe keeping". Basically the vault has a USB port which you'll need to plug in to. Once plugged in the vault will send you an NxN matrix such as the one below.

Monday-Friday the key to the vault is to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise. On Saturday and Sunday you have to rotate the matrix 90 degrees counter-clockwise. My dog accidentally got locked in the vault and the bank manager is no where to be found. Can someone help me write a program to get him out?

matrix=[[1,2,3,4,5],
        [6,7,8,9,10],
        [11,12,13,14,15],
        [16,17,18,19,20],
        [21,22,23,24,25]]

#Rotated 90 degrees clockwise
matrix=[[21, 16, 11, 6, 1], 
        [22, 17, 12, 7, 2],
        [23, 18, 13, 8, 3],
        [24, 19, 14, 9, 4],
        [25, 20, 15, 10, 5]]
Bonus points for fewer characters of code.
