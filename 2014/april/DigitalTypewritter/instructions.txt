Digital Typewritter
We're going way back for this one. Today's problem is creating a digital typewritter. When the program is run it will allow the user to enter text. When the user hits enter that line will be saved to a text file. The program runs until the following combination occurs: blank line > enter > "." > enter.

Bonus Round
Open the file after the user is done inputting text (after the blank line > enter > "." > enter has occurred)
Limit the number of characters per line to 72
