Musical Chorus
Music is one of the things that unites us all. Let's see if we can tap in to that connection with a quick program. Given an input file that contains song lyrics for a song, find the most common set of lyrics aka the chorus. A set of lyrics is consecutive lines where those exact consecutive lines appear elsewhere in the song. If no chorus can be identified print out a funny message. If there is a tie feel free to print out either set.

This program can be a bit challenging to optimize. A naive solution is perfectly fine. The comments are always open to discussions and theories on how to solve the problem. No code required.
